# Blog Storage

A small repo showing my experimients with various storage classes , and frameworks . i mainly explored:
- accessing all files via SAF
- accessing a single file via SAF
- accessing media/files via Media apis
- accessing files directly via recursion using uri,file and other File system classes
 
about internal projects:
- [demo_storage_apis](/demo_storageapis) is my main area of testing and debugging, where i checked with 5 approaches of accessing files in various sdks
- [proj_file_manager](/proj_file_manager) is a small fully fledge working file manager that i creadted 3 years ago and updated to 2023 style
- [proj_pdf_widget](/proj_pdfwidget) a small and simple app that allows creating widgets for PDF files. uses SAF framework to 1) access a PDF file 2) render it on imageview 3) share the pdf with the world
