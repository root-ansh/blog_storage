# Blog Storage

 I haven't got much time to explore all the storage world and write a detail article on it, as its a much bigger pie than i thought
 
So here is a small repo with all the projects in one 
- [demo_storage_apis](/demo_storageapis) is my main area of testing and debugging, where i checked with 5 approaches of accessing files in various sdks
- [proj_file_manager](/proj_file_manager) is a small fully fledge working file manager that i creadted 3 years ago and updated to 2023 style
- [proj_pdf_widget](/proj_pdfwidget) is a work in progress project
